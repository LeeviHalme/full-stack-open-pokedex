In this hypothetical situation, our team has chosen to use Ruby on Rails to build a web application. I have personally worked with RoR previously during a university course, and have used GitHub actions to automate its' testing and deployment.

The CI pipeline would consist of linting, testing, and building of the application. Commonly used linter with RoR is RuboCop, which can be used to enforce a consistent coding style (just like ESLint for JavaScript). For testing, RSpec is a popular choice for writing unit tests in Ruby. Building the application happends with the Rails CLI, which in the background uses a build tool called Kamal.

If, for some reason GitHub Actions or Jenkins are not suitable for the project, there are other tools available like Travis CI, CircleCI, or GitLab CI/CD (similar to GH Actions). It is worth noting that using a external (from version control) CI/CD service might require additional configuration and setup, but can provide more flexibility and customization options.

CI/CD setup using self-hosted or cloud-based services is a question of project requirements, team expertise, and budget. I would recommend using cloud-based CI/CD service built into version control platforms like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD if possible, due to their ease of use and integration with the development workflow. However, if the project for example requires on-premise infrastructure or specific security requirements, a self-hosted CI/CD solution might be more suitable.

Overall, I would recommend the most simple solution that meets the project requirements, and consider factors like scalability, maintainability, and cost when choosing a CI/CD setup.
